      <h3> Questions </h3>
      With the swtich statement in this assignment, we set it to true in order for
      it to run, but thats not the usual case for them is it? From what i gather they
      are mainly for long else/if scenarios, but if we intially set it to true then
      they will always have to run one line of code wont they? I might be way overthinking
      this too lol sorry
